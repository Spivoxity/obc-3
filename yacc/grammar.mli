(* Phases of processing *)

(* This module takes an active part in the parser generation in two
ways: first, when the values that represent tokens and nonterminals at
runtime are assigned, and second, when it computes which nonterminals
are _nullable_, i.e., derive the empty string. *)

val num_nts : int ref

(* num_toks -- count (genuine) tokens *)

(* nullable -- test if a nonterminal derives the empty string *)

val follow : symbol -> SymSet.t


(* SCC-based fixpoint calculation is needed in various places: to
   compute First and Follow sets for SLR; and also to compute lookahead
   sets in LALR.  The |fixpoint| function encapsulates a one-pass
   fixpoint algorithm that uses Tarjan's algorithm for finding the
   strongly connected components.  Call |fixpoint iter f kids|, where
   |iter| iterates over the nodes of the graph, |f| is a vector that
   contains the seed, and |kids x| returns the successors of a node |x|.
   The final value of |f| is the least solution of the fixpoint equation,

	f(x) = f_0(x) U Union { f(y) | y in kids x }.

   The values of |f| are sets of grammar symbols. *)
